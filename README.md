# Zero No Kiseki PPSSPP HD Texture Pack

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4EDhW31.png)

This pack contains mainly textures for the UI. This will never be finished and this is all I'll do for the game.

What to expect:
```
UI(Mostly done)
Extra Section(Mostly done)
Translated Battle Menu
Detective Notebook(Cooking, Fishnote, Bestiary) Won't be 100% complete because of the save file I used
```

# Latest Version: Ver.1.0
Download https://mega.nz/#!BpJxmRBS!GEUjaDFVZ2x8PZYEngFkbnfRm3wHN6URniRLN6uB9ug

## Installation
Extract the "NPJH50311" folder to your "TEXTURES" folder. **ppsspp\memstick\PSP\TEXTURES**

If the TEXTURES folder doesn't exist, create it.

Start PPSSPP, then go to Settings/Tools/Developer tools, scroll down to texture replacement and make sure "replace textures" is CHECKED.

## Notes
I recommend using the latest PPSSPP builds https://buildbot.orphis.net/ppsspp/

Also, you should change the emulator settings if you want.
